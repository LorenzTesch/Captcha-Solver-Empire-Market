# Captcha-Solver-Empire-Market

When one tries to access the darknet "Empire Market", they might be presented with a captcha.

![Example of an Empire Market captcha](https://github.com/LorenzTesch/Captcha-Solver-Empire-Market/blob/main/original.png?raw=true)

The final.js is able to provide the correct solution to it automatically.\
It must be executed on the page, when the captcha is visible.\
\
This was made long before the Empire Market went offline.
